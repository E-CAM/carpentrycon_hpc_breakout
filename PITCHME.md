## Keeping track of your opinions

- We will use Socrative to gather your opinions and help drive the discussion

Note:

- Highlight the outcomes through a Socrative quiz 
- Use the quiz to see how much people agree

## What's been done?

- Birds-of-a-Feather session at SC17 |
  - [Report](https://hpc-uk.github.io/sc17-hpccarpentry-bof/pdf/sc17-hpccarpentry-bof-report.pdf)
- Two novice lessons are "in the wild" |
  - [HPC-in-a-day](https://psteinb.github.io/hpc-in-a-day/)
  - [HPC intro](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-intro/)
  

Note:

- Give some context first.
- Mention that HPC intro is one of a set of lessons from [HPC Carpentry](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io)

## BoF Learner Profile

- Vague idea of what HPC is but not sure how this translates to their research.
- Lack of experience with Linux, command line, text editors, batch systems etc.
- Lack of knowledge about what HPC systems are: how are they put together, how do they enable faster/larger
  calculations and how are resources shared?
- Want to know how to support themselves when things don’t work and keen to learn more.

Notes:

- Working environment is foreign to them
- Socrative: Check do people agree that this is the user profile that should be targeted by HPC Novice
  - Broadly Agree
  - Too novice
  - Disagree

---

## Prerequisites

- BoF
  
  Basic Linux shell use and scripting

- hpc-intro:
  
  “There are no real prerequisites for this lesson, but prior programming and/or command line experience will be
  helpful.”
- hpc-in-a-day:
    
  “If you have already written small programs with a language of your choice and know the difference between a
  'variable' and a 'function' and obtain a minimal knowledge of using the UNIX command line (e.g. if you have completed
  shell-novice, you are good to go).”

Notes:

- Can give flexibility, but less prereqs means more time required
- Use socrative to gauge support for prereqs:
  - Minimal programming experience
    - What level and how to gauge?
    - Depends a little on lesson final content
  - Shell

Notes:

- Use socrative to gauge agreement and placement
  - Core, non-core, not suited
  - Dedicated episode or distributed?

---?image=assets/image/Topics6-10.png&opacity=100

Notes:

- Use socrative to gauge agreement and placement
  - Core, non-core, not suited
  - Dedicated episode or distributed?

---?image=assets/image/OtherTopics.png&opacity=100

Notes:

- Use socrative to gauge agreement and placement
  - Core, non-core, not suited
  - Dedicated episode or distributed?
- What's missing/overlooked?
  - Keep in mind Learner Profile and time restrictions
- How much time for modular components?

## Portability

- What aspects affect the portability of lessons |
  - Access (keys, passwords, ...)
  - Schedulers (queues, limits)
  - File systems (number, type)
  - Module environment (module names)
- Both lessons have made efforts to make the material generic |
- HPC-in-a-day uses settings in the “_config.yml” file for Jekyll functionality to customise the lesson
  - File system names, scheduler, code snippets
